PRO-C9: BACKGROUND COLOR CHANGER
This is a simple, four-mode webpage concocted using p5 libraries.
https://github.com/Adi00009/P9
The first mode - painting - allows you to draw anything you desire using a simple 10*10 brush. 
Arrow keys to move brush and space key to clear canvas.

The second option is a background colour changer, which will prompt you for four colours of your desire. 
Each arrow key will change the bgcolour to the respective colour you chose.

The next feature uses the left and right arrow keys to change the greyscale value of the bgcolour, i.e., 
a monochromatic spectrum of shades between black and white.

By the time you reach the last mode, namely a superficial hide-and-seek game, you're a professional thief! Your challenge is to bag the diamong away
by merely touching it.

I hope you enjoy this little creation of mine; paint fresh, versatile shapes and objects out of your vivid imagination; watch the background change 
to your favourite colours and have a rollicking, fun-crammed time racing for the diamond. I can bet it'll slip away when you get inches from it... :)
